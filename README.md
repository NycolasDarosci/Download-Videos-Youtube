# Download-Videos-Youtube

Download Videos from youtube. Made with Python

`pip install yt_dlp`

some features would be interesting:

- implement selenium lib to automate download videos from browser
- you would not need copy and paste links manually

note: there was a error ocurring with pytube when trying to download whatever video or audio. Check the issue: [link](https://github.com/pytube/pytube/issues/2086)
